= Problem Definition

PwC UK operates a hybrid working model, so daily office attendance varies considerably by site and weekday. Facilities Management (FM) uses attendance to plan catering and cleaning, and Real Estate uses it to allocate space across teams. With little forward visibility, FM risks food waste, mis-sized cleaning shifts and shortfalls on busy days.

Attendance is also shifted by external events such as bank holidays and rail strikes, which are currently logged through a manual form that is slow and misses events.

The work sits within the Real Estate Data Analytics (REDA) team, whose Databricks lakehouse holds aggregated daily headcount per office. Forecasting is currently limited to Power BI's built-in forecast, which has not been validated. Without a validated forecast, FM cannot quantify the benefit of earlier planning, so any model must beat the heuristic of assuming attendance equals the same weekday last week.

= Project Aim and Objectives

*Aim:* To develop and evaluate a 1-14 day office attendance forecasting pipeline that outperforms seasonal naive and Power BI baselines, ingests public disruption data automatically and provides calibrated prediction intervals.

*Objectives:*
+ Agree KPIs, horizon and simulation assumptions.
+ Automate ingestion of bank holidays, strikes and weather warnings into the existing medallion architecture.
+ Benchmark seasonal naive and Power BI forecasts as baselines.
+ Compare SARIMAX, LightGBM and XGBoost using rolling-origin validation per office, measured by MAE and MAPE.
+ Identify which events most shift attendance using feature importance.
+ Deliver an FM dashboard and estimate the potential planning benefit.
+ Evaluate results and recommend next steps.

= Research Plan

Prior work will be identified through Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect and arXiv, accessed via the QMUL library, plus Databricks and MLflow documentation for implementation practice. Indicative search terms include "office occupancy forecasting", "hybrid work space utilisation", "time series forecasting exogenous events", "gradient boosting forecasting", "rolling origin evaluation", "conformal prediction time series" and "forecast accuracy metrics".

Peer-reviewed work from 2018 onwards will be prioritised for methods, and post-2020 studies for hybrid working behaviour. Grey literature such as consultancy reports will be labelled and treated cautiously, with quality judged on peer review, data transparency and relevance to office settings. Findings will inform model selection, feature design, validation strategy and interval calibration.

AI tools may support discovery and summarisation, but every source will be read and verified directly and managed in mybib, with no AI-generated references.

= Identification of Technologies, Tools and/or Datasets

*Platform:* Databricks with Delta tables and MLflow, chosen because the data already resides there and Unity Catalog provides governed access, lineage and experiment tracking. Alternatives are local Python with DuckDB (cheaper, but ungoverned) and Azure ML (heavier infrastructure for a small problem).

*Models:* Python with statsmodels for SARIMAX (an interpretable classical benchmark) (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2021), plus LightGBM (Ke et al., 2017) and XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016), which handle exogenous event features flexibly. Prophet is excluded to limit scope, and deep learning because daily office series are small and interpretability matters to FM.

*Data:* Synthetic data is the primary dataset, generated in Python with Faker and custom simulation code. It mirrors the schema of the REDA attendance, office and date tables, with attendance patterns and event effects simulated from documented assumptions. Bank holidays, Met Office warnings, TfL disruption and strike dates are real public data. No real PwC attendance data is used.

Dependencies: modelling depends on the synthetic data generator and ingestion pipeline. The dashboard depends on the chosen model and validated intervals. The report is written after the gateway, outside this schedule.

*Ethics and compliance:* The project uses synthetic data generated from table schemas only, with no real PwC values and no human participants. QMUL ethics requirements will be confirmed with the module organiser, and confidentiality limits on describing PwC systems will be agreed with the line manager.
